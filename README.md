### Overview of contents
This repository contains map packages for Gillreath-Brown, Nagaoka, and Wolverton (2019). The map packages contains all GIS data associated with the analyses described and presented in the publication.
The map packages were created in ArcGIS (10.2.2); however, the packages will work in recent versions (e.g., I was able to open the packages in ArcGIS 10.6.1, when tested on February 17, 2019).
